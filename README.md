# SVM-KNN

School project that use vgg16 to extract feature and using svm and knn to predicting model.

The objective of this project is to use Keras and Sklearn

## Overview

## Usage 1: SVM

* Delete the old files in svmlinear folder for running code.
* Run file [svm_model](svm_model.py)

## Usage 2: KNN

* Delete the old files in knn folder for running code.
* Run file [knn_model](knn_model.py)
