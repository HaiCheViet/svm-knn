# SVM-KNN

School project that use vgg16 to extract feature and using svm and knn to predicting model.

The objective of this project is to use Keras and Sklearn

## Overview

## Usage 1: SVM-linear

* Delete the old files in `exp/svmlinear` folder for training again code.
* Run file [svm_linear_model](svm_linear_model.py): `python svm_linear_model.py`

## Usage 2: SVM-Non-linear

* Delete the old files in `exp/knn` folder for training again code.
* Run file [svm_nonlinear_model](svm_nonlinear_model.py): `python svm_nonlinear_model.py`
